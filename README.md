# Scrap-Detection
This project, "Scrap Detection," integrates scanCONTROL 3000-50 sensors for 3D profiling of workpieces, controlled via B&amp;R Automation Studio using UDP. It captures, combines, and plots 3D data from two laser sensors. The app uses PyQt5, Matplotlib, NumPy, and pymodbus. Contributions are welcome, licensed under MIT.
